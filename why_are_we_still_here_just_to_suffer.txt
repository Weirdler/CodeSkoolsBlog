I seek to improve upon my computer skills and pursue a career among computer development and computer science in general. Growing up I always loved to try and figure out the coding and behind the scenes stuff of the games my brothers and I played. I enjoyed it enough to spark an interest in computer programming and development. Plus I mean we know some games that DESERVE a remaster or a reboot.
